				<h2>Chapter 1: Understanding the Search Engine Landscape</h2>
				
				<section id="chapter_overview">
					<h3>Chapter Overview</h3>
					<p>This chapter will layout the basic principles for understanding the search engine landscape by first explaining the elements of the search engine results page, second by outlining why indexing is necessary to appear in the results, and third by demonstrating how search engines function by evaluating a website’s own code and the code of the websites that link to it.</p>

					<h4>Search Engine Results Page (SERP)</h4>
					<p>A search engine results page is comprised of four main elements, which are defined below:  the query, paid listings, Google+ Local, and organic listings.  The strategies in this guide focus on how to increase your website's position in the organic listings and Google+ Local because customers generally focus almost exclusively on the first results page and the higher listings on the first page.</p>

					<section class="definition">
						<h5>Definitions:</h5> <!-- style with a pseudo selector: any <h5> nested within a section w/ a class of "definition" -->
						<ul>
							<li><strong>Query</strong> - The word or phrase that you type into the search bar.</li>
							<li><strong>Paid listings</strong> - Results that can be purchased through Google’s paid search platform, AdWords.</li>
							<li><strong>Google+ Local</strong> - Unpaid listings on Google that identify the most relevant businesses in a local area and show the location of those businesses on a map</li>
							<li><strong>Organic Search Results</strong> - Listings that are generated by the search engine based on the search engine’s evaluation of relevance.</li>
						</ul>

					<h4>Indexing</h4>
					<p>A search engine is a program such as Google or Yahoo that organizes information in a process called “indexing.”  The process of indexing a website can take several months for the search engine to complete.  The search engine has to evaluate the data on your page to assess what the website is about, so that your website will be properly placed in the results.</p>

					<p>An analogy helps in understanding this concept:  If your webpage is a page and your website a book, then it will only be found by customers who are browsing through Google’s “library.”  If you aren’t in the “library,” then your book will not be read, even though it has been written.  Google has to place you in the appropriate section of the library so that your book will be categorized properly.</p>

					<p>Google indexes your website in several stages:</p>
					<section class="step-by-step">
						<ol>
							<li>Google finds a link to your page from another page. (Google “hears” about your “book”)</li>
							<li>The Googlebot visits your page. (Google “reads” your “book”)</li>
							<li>Google analyzes the data on your page and copies it into its database (Google categorizes your “book” by its exact title, but not necessarily by a topic like “science fiction.”)</li>
								<ol>
									<li>In this phase, you will find your website if you search by your name “myscrapbookingmaterials.com,” but not necessarily in a keyword search as “scrapbooking materials.” </li>
								</ol>
							<li>Google shows your page in a general search and assigns you a pager rank value.<li>
						</ol>
					</section>

					<p>The purpose of the search engine is to display the most accurate and relevant information to your query.  In general, the search engines give the most credence to the links or citations from other websites to your website (i.e. what your friends say about you).  These links are the votes that determine a website’s authority (reliability) and relevance for a specific keyword. </p>
